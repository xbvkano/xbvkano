            <p class ="WelcomingParagraph"> My name is Marcos Kano, and I am a dedicated student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My academic pursuits reflect a strong 
                passion for software development, with a particular interest in becoming a full stack developer. Currently, I am in my junior year, pursuing a double major in Computer Science 
                and Mathematics, alongside a double concentration in Software Engineering and Information Assurance.

                As the co-founder of Evidence LLC, I consistently identify opportunities to leverage my skills to enhance the company's operations. I have successfully developed software 
                that is currently integrated into the company's daily workflow. Seeking to further enhance my abilities and gain valuable industry insights, I am currently seeking an 
                internship opportunity to grow as a developer and broaden my knowledge within the field.

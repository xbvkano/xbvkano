- I am working on the FES project for my internship at DRIVEN NeuroRecovery Center; I am creating a simulator for their Functional Electrical Stimulation. It has been going great! I recently got a certificate from code academy in Phaser.js Framework, which I will use in this project. I have been learning so much, from CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to working with Blender to create the animations for the program.

- Fun Facts: I am originally from Brazil! Born in Sao Paulo, lived in Rio de Janeiro for a while, and then moved to the United States when I was about to turn 12 years old. I graduated high school with 75 college credits, an associate's degree from the College of Southern Nevada with a Physical Science degree, and a scholarship to complete my bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics, which I am working on right now at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Also! I was born on March 14, 2005, Ï€ day!
